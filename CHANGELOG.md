/fail/station 13 Changelog
==========================

Changes made between production versions (not including upstream changes from /tg/station)

Version 0.0.1
-------------

Major changes for this version involve making most many pre-built atmospherics objects (and a few others) destructable and/or rebuildable for super-extended rounds, as planned for /fail/station.

* *BREAKING CHANGE:* Configuration renamed to *.dist so it doesn't interfere with local configuration. BACK UP YOUR SHIT.
* Digital Valve can be disassembled with a wrench, and can now be ordered at the Pipe Dispenser. Gives borgs and AIs more options, and atmos techs more opportunities to blamed for everything.
