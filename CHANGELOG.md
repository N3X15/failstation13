/fail/station 13 Changelog
==========================

Changes made between production versions (not including upstream changes from /tg/station)

Version 0.0.1
-------------

TODO:
* vending machines are indestructable and irreplacable
* impossible to replace:
 * display cases
 * glass fireaxe cases
 * hydroponics trays
 * gasses
 * newscasters
 * tank transfer valves (by design, though)
 * proximity sensors
 * igniters
 * timers
 * cameras

Major changes for this version involve making most many pre-built atmospherics objects (and a few others) destructable and/or rebuildable for super-extended rounds, as planned for /fail/station.

* *BREAKING CHANGE:* Configuration renamed to *.dist so it doesn't interfere with local configuration. BACK UP YOUR SHIT.
* Digital Valve can be disassembled with a wrench, and can now be ordered at the Pipe Dispenser. Gives borgs and AIs more options, and atmos techs more opportunities to blamed for everything.
* Supply shuttle now offers replacement gasses and pipe dispenser parts.
* Pipe dispensers can now be constructed like any other machine, given pipe dispenser circuit boards.
